bomberman-2014-locque_d
=======================
Bomberman copycat game

Graphic library : from school, not included

I worked on the IA of bomberman, and the map generation of the game.

IA :Lua language and wrap into C++ with Lunar 
http://lua-users.org/wiki/CppBindingWithLunar

The IA is pretty strong and would certainly kill you 90% of the time (if the bot don't kill each other first)

Algorithm : 

- A*
- Set objective (bonus or kill someone depending of the situation)
- Aggressive / Defensive mode

Upgrade of the simple IA : http://www.tigen.org/jyaif/Article/Bomberdude_ai.htm (in french)
